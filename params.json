To verify if you have php cli installed, open your terminal command prompt, and then type.\r\n\r\n  php -v\r\n\r\nIf you will receive the php version number, then you are good to go.\r\n\r\n2. Go to your config.php file inside the application/config and make sure the following line looks like below:\r\n\r\n  $config['uri_protocol'] = 'AUTO';\r\n\r\n3. After that line, add the following line\r\n\r\n  $config['uri_protocol'] = isset($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']) ? 'PATH_INFO' : 'CLI';  \r\n\r\n4. Save the file...\r\n\r\n5. Put Matches.php inside the controllers directory.\r\n\r\n6. From terminal or command prompt go to the application's index.php and type:\r\n\r\n  php index.php matches\r\n\r\n7. If everything went well, you should be greeted by the Matches.\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\nYou can start using the Matches by writing:\r\n\r\n  php index.php matches [COMMAND]\r\n\r\n...where [COMMAND] can be:\r\n\r\n**create_app name_of_app** - creates a MVC stack (controller, model, view) having name_of_app as names.\r\n\r\n**create_controller name_of_controller** - creates a controller having name_of_controller as name.\r\n\r\n**create_model name_of_model** - creates a model having name_of_model as name.\r\n\r\n**create_view name_of_view** - creates a controller having name_of_view as file name.\r\n\r\n\r\n#History\r\nThis project started from a great idea posted by @veedeoo [veedeoo@gmail.com] on http://www.daniweb.com/web-development/php/code/477847/codeigniter-cli-trainer-script-creates-simple-application\r\n#Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 @avenirer [avenir.ro@gmail.com]\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long as the name is changed.\r\n\r\nDON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\nDo whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.\r\nBeing a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:\r\n1a.
